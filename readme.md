NConfig
===============

NConfig is an extensible .NET library, that makes application configuration for multiple environments as simple as possible.

Installing NConfig
------------------

    Install-Package NConfig

Motivation
----------

- Do you have multiple projects that all have their own configuration files?

- Do you have have different configurations for different environments, such as development, testing, staging and production?

- Do you have to update each client when changes are made to configuration values?

If any of the above sound familiar, NConfig can help!

NConfig allows all application configuration to live in a centralized location, and using runtime filtering, apply the configuration value required.
